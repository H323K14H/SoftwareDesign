# Software Design Methodologies:

## Cohesion and Coupling in Structured design:

| Cohesion | Coupling |
| ----- | ----- |
| Cohesion is the concept of intra-module | Coupling is the concept of inter-module. |
|Cohesion represents the relationship within a module. | Coupling represents the relationships between modules. |
| Increasing cohesion is good for software. | Increasing coupling is avoided for software. |
| Cohesion represents the functional strength of modules. | Coupling represents the independence among modules. |
| Highly cohesive gives the best software. | Whereas loosely coupling gives the best software. |
| In cohesion, the module focuses on a single thing. | In coupling, modules are connected to the other modules. |
| Cohesion is created between the same module. | Coupling is created between  two different modules. |

### There are 6 Types of cohesion:
1) Functional Cohesion.
2) Procedural Cohesion. 
3) Temporal Cohesion.
4) Sequential Cohesion.
5) Layer Cohesion.
6) Communication Cohesion.

### There are 6 Types of coupling:
1) Common Coupling.
2) External Coupling. 
3) Control Coupling.
4) Stamp Coupling.
5) Data Coupling
6) Content Coupling.
